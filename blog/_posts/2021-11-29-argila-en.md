**We present three articles on collective creation and technological appropriation written by the art collective *TAG Taller d'Intangibles* (“TAG Intangibles Workshop”) between 2006 and 2012. We retrieve these articles as contributions that invite to reflect on and discuss technology, collective artistic creation, authority of authorship, and technological and creative appropriation.**

***TAG Taller d'Intangibles* is an art collective created in 1996. Especially during this period, the collective combined artistic projects with research, reflection on the practice itself, and written production.**

**These articles were redacted in the socio-political context of 2008 crisis, and the Arab Spring, 15-M and Occupy movements. They were written after the movement against the Gulf Wars, the first waves of experimental net.art, emergence of wiki systems, web 2.0, and «collaborative» platforms.**

The second article of the series aims to question the principle of authority exercised by authorship or specialized knowledge on the technologies we use collectively, exploring the possibility of a radically modelable collective creation system, like a block of clay, where everyone can be the administrator with a steep learning curve, and a reasonable robustness that does not impede its operation.

## Presentation ##

The “*Argila*” (“Clay”) proposal arises from the *Germinador* project launched by the *TAG Taller d'Intangibles* (“TAG Intangibles Workshop”) team in October 2005, in order to collect and generate proposals for online collective creation.

It is a theoretical proposal aimed at stimulating the discussion about online collective creation systems. We imagined a hypothetical online system, and we compared it to an analogical metaphor in order to visualize the challenges more clearly. We suggest starting from the challenges it poses, in order to critically review some existing creative environments, as well as to use these challenges as a starting point to generate new systems.

*Argila* raises the possibility of creating a collective creation-oriented online multi-user system that would meet the following characteristics:

- The users would have to be able to reprogram it as they used it

- The programming would have to be easy for any participant to grasp

- It should be robust despite the changes

- It would have to be distributed in order to ensure decentralized control

The purpose of this approach is not so much to achieve a design, rather it is to initiate a discussion that allows us to question the principle of authority exercised by authorship or specialized knowledge regarding the technologies we use collectively.

The fact that online creation takes place in technologically mediated work environments suggests that a certain purpose and a set of conditions predate the aesthetic experience of the participants. It implies a linear model, in which the author (artist, programmer, designer...) begins first by defining the conditions of the experience, and then the participants interact under those conditions. Although interactions between participants can trigger the emergence of properties that were not envisaged by the author, the experience generally takes place within the boundaries set by the very design. These environments follow a linear process in the sense that certain things come either before or after other things, and this linearity results in a varying degree of control over the experience. Someone previously determines some boundaries that the participants cannot change later.

Would it be possible to design a working environment that participants could modify as they use it, completely changing its purpose and rules, in a way that they would become not only the co-authors of the aesthetic experience of using it, but also the co-authors of the experience of reprogramming the working environment itself? Such an environment might be considered non-linear for two reasons. First, because there would not be a before and after. Instead, there would be moments of defining the conditions of use, and these conditions could be applied at the same instant. And second, because the participants could take control of the system, including its purpose. It would resemble a biological process, because it would be designed in a way that its own metabolism -the interaction between the participants- would end up altering it completely and would evolve it towards a different environment in an unpredictable way, but at the same time ensuring that it would continue being a multi-user working environment.

Metaphorically speaking, this environment would be like clay. Clay is a material that can be shaped into any form, recycled and re-modelled by other people and for other purposes, if taken to the kneading trough. This article aims to point out some basic questions about the characteristics that a “clay environment” should have, and about the discussion threads that such a proposal can initiate.

## Context: the germinator ##

We have been identifying systems, practices, and processes, which we try to describe by showing the similarities and differences between them. This compilation work also serves to suggest variants or generate new proposals.

This work and the proposals bring up the reflection that perhaps we should take into account not only the conditions of experience but also who or which factors define these conditions. From this line of thinking we arrive at a proposal in which the definition of the conditions would be one of the changeable parts. There emerges *Argila* as a theoretical proposal to propel this discussion.

We will begin by describing some models to contrast them with the proposed model. Then we will go over the four challenges outlined in the proposal one by one. We will explain the experiences based on using a mud block to explore the relation with the metaphor. Finally, we will try to justify the meaning of making such a proposal, and the discussion threads it can initiate.

## Contrast: open work, closed system ##

It seems paradoxical, but some of the proposals that provide the resources and conditions to create collectively on the internet do not usually provide the participants with the possibility to change those conditions.

This is the case in some *net.art* works. In the model they follow, the participants have a limited experience defined by some conditions previously imposed by an artist-programmer. Whoever creates the system, whether an individual or a group, has a position that other participants cannot obtain.

A strong version of this model would be the cases where the software linked to the system and other elements created to provide the experience are kept under a license that restricts their use and prevents their modification by third parties without the permission of the authors. A weak version would be represented by those cases where the system is a free software and/or other necessary elements are made available under a copyleft license, which allows them to be distributed and modified freely. Supposedly, the participants could clone the system to another server and modify it. But this is not the model *Argila* proposes, either. As we will see later in more detail, *Argila* seeks to eliminate the need to replicate the program or create alternative development lines.

## Contrast: layers of an onion ##

The most important free software development projects offer us another model where there is a large group of participants of the experience and a smaller group of system developers. People in the first group can move on to the latter, though it might be difficult due to social norms or level of knowledge.

Some processes of free software development by the community are described using the metaphor “layers of an onion”. According to this model, there are different “layers” or levels of involvement in the development of a software. There is an outer layer of many users, who simply use the software and, maybe, report some errors, to a central core. The inner layer is formed by one (the maintainer) or a few users, who decide the incorporation of contributions, the development lines, and they coordinate pending tasks. There are various degrees of contribution and commitment to the project in between. Theoretically, anyone can move from one layer of this model to another. The fact of gradually going inwards may depend on election and/or social recognition norms, the level of knowledge or the capacity to acquire that knowledge, and the availability of each person. This layout has been used to describe projects like the development of *Linux kernel*, *Debian* distribution, or the server software *Apache* (VAN WENDEL DE JOODE et alt., 2003).

The onion model is surely a good way of organizing software production, optimizing efforts and establishing a good communication between users and programmers. At the same time, it lays the ground for gradual incorporation of new developers, and guarantees the continuity of the project. But with *Argila*, our experiment proposal is to find a model where all users participating in collective creation experience would (or can easily) be potential developers or transformers of the conditions of this experience. This would mean a steep learning curve as to how to participate in collective creation and in terms of the knowledge to modify the software.

## Contrast: trunks and branches ##

When the access to the source code and the freedom to modify it are guaranteed, free software makes it possible for a person, group or organization to take the program and develop a different version. But in practice, in the main development projects, there is a joint evolution of the software on a single "trunk", and the improvements are incorporated following the onion model. New versions that correct errors or incorporate new functionalities are published one after another.

It is always possible to clone the program and develop it on a different line. This is called a fork and it does not happen very often. Since the goal is to make a good program, creating forks would mean to disperse the efforts of the community. It usually occurs when there is an unresolved conflict. The new line of development aspires to replace the old one and in most cases one replaces the other. A less conflicting case would be when a very complex system with multiple functionalities is divided into several projects, and each of them would enhance some of its aspects.

The possibility of creating forks at a given time is a conflict resolution mechanism and a guarantee to avoid the temptations of monopolization or excessive appropriation of projects. However, with the *Argila* proposal we don't think of a system in versions nor with ramifications, but a system that evolves smoothly without ceasing to function.
