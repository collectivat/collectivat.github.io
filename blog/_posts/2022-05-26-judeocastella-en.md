## What is the project about?

“Judeoespañol: connecting both shores of the Mediterranean” is a project developed jointly by the organizations Col·lectivaT, based in Barcelona, and SKAD, based in Istanbul. Its objective is to contribute to the survival of the Judeo-Spanish language and the Sephardic culture in the digital space, through the implementation of open source technologies and the creation of networks of organizations between the two shores of the Mediterranean. This work must also make it possible to value and disseminate good digital preservation practices that can be useful for other minority languages and cultures.

## In what actions is it specified?

The project has a double general objective:

On the one hand, it aims to contribute to the **survival of the Judeo-Spanish language and the Sephardic culture in the digital space**, through the creation of networks between civil society organizations from Turkey and Spain and the improvement of their knowledge of good digital practices. 

On the other hand, it seeks to generate **awareness about the Sephardic community** and the cultural heritage that it has managed to preserve, which is shared by the populations of both shores of the Mediterranean.

To carry out this general purpose, the project is specified in different areas of action, which are fundamental:

- Increase the number of available linguistic and cultural resources and promote the consumption of digital content in Judeo-Spanish.
- Create language learning resources.
- Digitize the cultural and linguistic heritage of the Sephardic community and make it accessible through a digital archive.
- Generate innovative machine learning tools, specifically for machine translation and speech synthesis of Judeo-Spanish.
- Create critical awareness of the digital divide faced by minority languages in Spain and Turkey, with special emphasis on Judeo-Spanish.

### Workshops

We have carried out four workshops, in Turkey and Spain, with the title 'Let no language be left behind in the digital age'. In them we have shared the experiences and learning of the project and the methods used for the preservation and promotion of Judeo-Spanish as a minority language.

## What is the linguistic digital divide?

The linguistic digital divide refers to the unequal distribution of resources between the hegemonic languages and those with fewer speakers and institutional support in terms of accessibility, use and impact of information and communication technologies. In this sense, only 5% of the world's languages are represented in the virtual environment.

Faced with the danger of digital extinction of minority languages and the underrepresentation of diversity, open source technologies are a key tool for promoting the intergenerational transmission of linguistic and cultural traditions.

The project "Judeo-Spanish: connecting both shores of the Mediterranean" claims the use of technology to empower speakers of a minority language that is in danger of extinction and to link, after hundreds of years, two territories united by a history of forced migration.

## What are the Judeo-Spanish language and the Sephardic culture?

Judeo-Spanish is a minority language and in danger of extinction, which derives from Old Castilian and has received the influence of Hebrew. The Sephardic community, descendant of the Jewish people expelled from Spain by the Inquisition more than 500 years ago and taking refuge in the Ottoman Empire and other territories of the world, speaks and has managed to preserve Judeo-Spanish. Today, the Sephardic language and culture are part of the common heritage of the Mediterranean, the Iberian Peninsula and Anatolia.

## Who finances it?

The project 'Judeo-Spanish: Language that connects the two shores of the Mediterranean' is financed within the framework of the “Common Cultural Heritage Subsidy Program: Preservation and Dialogue between Turkey and the EU (CCH-II)” implemented by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of the Republic of Türkiye with the financial support of the European Union.
