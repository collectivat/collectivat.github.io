On Saturday, February 17th, we are organizing the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/952971629738855" target="_blank">**Awal Datathon**</a>, a space to **collect written and oral data in the Tamazight language and promote its presence in the digital space**. The activity, which will take place **from 11:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. at the El CIEMEN headquarters** (<a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/wFYK1ZjtwgePPiw4A" target="_blank">c/ Rocafort, 242 bis, 2n, Barcelona</a>), is the first of its kind aimed at promoting the creation of open-source digital tools in Tamazight and is part of the Awal project led by the _Centre Internacional Escarré per a les Minories Ètniques i les Nacions (CIEMEN)_, Col·lectivaT, and the _Casa Amaziga de Catalunya_.

The gathering is open to Tamazight speakers of all genders, ages, and dialectal variants to carry out an **intensive day of collective translations and recordings**. During the marathon, attendees will be required to translate short sentences to and from Tamazight, validate translations made by others, and record their voice to contribute to speech data. To participate, contributors must bring their smartphone or laptop and connect to the <a href="https://awaldigital.org/" target="_blank">Awal portal</a> and <a href="https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/zgh" target="_blank">Common Voice</a>, where all contributions will be recorded. Instructions for registration and contribution to the project are explained on the website and in more detail in an <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/v/Lipk2JTPHYXov6BP/" target="_blank">explanatory video</a>.

We will provide **linguistic support** at all times to address any doubts that may arise with Tamazight, due to differences between everyday and standardized language. Technical assistance will also be available for those who are less familiar with digital tools, thereby helping to alleviate **inequalities inherent in the digital divide**. Individuals unable to attend the event can make their contributions from home and virtually join the meeting. Throughout the day, we will open a virtual space for inquiries, to ask any questions that may arise and share with other contributors.

The initiative is a great opportunity to **build community, improve the language skills of participants, and make a significant impact on the digital presence of Tamazight**. We encourage all Tamazight speakers to participate in the event and the project, share their progress, and join the movement!
