description: "As an association which provides open source language tools for the Catalan speaking community, Softcatalà wanted to have a open source ASR system in order to be used by developers, makers and possibly for providers of techonological products to integrate Catalan in their services. We have leveraged the publicly avaliable subtitled videos from Catalan television to create an initial version of an open source ASR in Catalan using the CMUSphinx technology. We have published the trained ASR models and the necessary scripts to build them in <a href='https://github.com/collectivat/cmusphinx-models'>github</a> for the use of the community."
