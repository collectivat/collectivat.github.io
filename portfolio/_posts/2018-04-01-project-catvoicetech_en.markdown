description: "As part of our mission, we build resources and generate open knowledge on Catalan speech technologies, specifically automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech synthesis (TTS). Our work throughout years is sponsored by various public and non-profit institutions. Thanks to support from <a href='https://www.softcatala.org/'>Softcatalà Association</a>, we developed the first large speech corpus for Catalan from television broadcasts and released an initial open-source ASR model. We further extended available speech data to 851 hours using Catalan parliamentary proceedings with funds from <a href='http://cultura.gencat.cat/'>Catalan Department of Culture</a> and <a href='https://www.bsc.es/'>Barcelona Supercomputing Center</a>. Also, we have built the first neural network-based speech synthesis application for Catalan, <a href='https://catotron.cat'>Catotron</a>, again with support from Catalan Department of Culture. All our resources and workshop materials are released openly in our <a href='/asr'>resources page</a> and <a href='http://github.com/CollectivaT-dev'>Github repository</a>."
