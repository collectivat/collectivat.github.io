description: "SuportMuTu aimed to guarantee the accessibility of Catalonia’s health protocol channels and Barcelona’s neighbourhood solidarity groups into some of the most common migrant languages of Barcelona: Arabic, Urdu and Chinese. By combining AI-based language technology with a volunteer network, SuportMuTu helped serve Telegram channels in these languages in parallel to their original versions so that everyone can get informed and support each other during the lockdown. <p>For more information, refer to our <a href='/blog/2021-05-31-closing-suportmutu-en/'>blogpost</a>."
