description: "The Dossier <a href='https://www.nationalia.cat/documents/coldc_19_20_drets_colectius_catalunya.pdf'>«Minority peoples, collective rights and global justice in Catalonia»</a> deals with the situation of collective rights of minority groups originating in Catalonia and was published in the 6th edition of the Collective Rights Collection of CIEMEN. The dossier is based on the research and analysis work carried out in 2019 by researchers Mariona Lladonosa (University of Lleida, UdL) and Özgür Güneş Öztürk (Col·lectivaT, UdL) on the main discourses and strategies being promoted in Catalonia in terms of collective rights. This paper proposes an approach to address the issue of collective rights in Catalonia with a perspective of global justice."
