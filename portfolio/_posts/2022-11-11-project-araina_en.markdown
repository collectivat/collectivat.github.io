description: "It is currently not possible for machines to speak or understand Aranese. For this to be possible, a database with hundreds of hours of voice recordings in this variety of the Occitan language is needed. To remedy this, from Col·lectivaT we have launched <a href='www.projecte-araina.org'>Projecte Araina: votzes en Aranés</a> to promote the creation of the first speech corpus in Aranese based on collective participation. To start collecting Aranese voice samples, we have organized a voice marathon where the voices of Aranese speakers of various ages, registers and languages will be recorded. <p>For more information, see our <a href='/blog/2022-11-23-inici-projecte-araina/'>blog post</a>."
